## What is meant by the term web stack?

It refers to the components or technologies/languages/operating sytems/etc used to build a web site. For instance: 

* 1. "LAMP" stack: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP

>Linux is the OS that is essentially used, but another word we call it is AMP stack because you can use Linux, you can use Mac, you can use Windows. So LAMP, MAMP, or SAMP for Windows. Apache being the web server, SQL being the database, and PHP being the interpreter language.

* 2. "MEAN" stack: MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJs

>MEAN stack. MongoDB is the database. It’s a NoSQL database meaning that it’s a non-structured database, which is different fundamentally from Sequel. Node is the web server kind of like Apache. Express and Angular are two different frameworks. We talked about frameworks, where it’s essentially a structure of files and folders and also libraries. Express is the back end, I guess you would say, server side, framework. Angular also, which is a new, very good, hyped up, JavaScript framework.

* 3. Ruby on Rails. 

>Ruby is a language. Rails is a framework. Ruby on Rails uses a lot more than just a language and a framework. It still has a web server. By default, it includes a SQL type database called SQLite, but you can also plug other kinds of databases
